It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, you can still create the `README.md` file manually. Here's how:

1. Open any text editor (e.g., VS Code, Notepad, Sublime).
2. Copy the content below into a new file.
3. Save the file as `README.md`.

# NYC Crash Insights – Interactive Website

This is the companion website for the **NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions Analysis (2018–2021)** project.

It is designed for public awareness, presentation, and educational use.

## 🌐 Website Contents

- `main.js`, `wheelzoom.js` – JavaScript functionality
- `style.css` – Stylesheet for layout and visuals
